# Performance Specs

This folder sets measurable performance targets and plans so AIX and engineers can guard against regressions.

- **Role:** Define budgets, measurement plans, risk areas, optimization tactics, and regression guardrails for pages, components, and services.
- **What lives here:** Budgets/targets (LCP, CLS, TTFB, bundle sizes, etc.), measurement methods, hot paths, optimization plans, regression checks/tests, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (to avoid suggesting regressions), frontend/backend engineers, performance/ops owners.
- **Source links:** Reference related routes/components specs in `/specs/routes-content/` and `/specs/components/`, and ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`.
