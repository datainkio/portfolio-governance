## Performance & Budget
- Frame budget targets, media limits, lazy/conditional loading rules; how to measure.

## Accessibility

## Testing & Validation
- How to verify (recordings, perf metrics, visual regression).

## Decisions
- Key choices with rationale; links to ADRs.

## Open Questions
- Unknowns, risks, follow-ups.
