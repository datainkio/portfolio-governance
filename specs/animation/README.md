# Animation Specs

This folder defines motion principles and reusable patterns so AIX and developers apply consistent, performant animation across the product.

- **Role:** Capture motion tokens, primitives, and component-level patterns with accessibility and performance constraints.
- **What lives here:** Global motion principles, reusable curves/utilities, per-component patterns, performance budgets, reduce-motion rules, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (to suggest correct motion defaults), engineers, designers.
- **Source links:** Use ADRs in `/docs/decisions/` for accepted motion choices and reference component specs in `/specs/components/` when patterns are component-specific.
