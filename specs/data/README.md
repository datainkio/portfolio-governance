# Data Specs

This folder captures data contracts, pipelines, and storage details so AIX can enforce correct shapes and dependencies.

- **Role:** Describe sources, schemas, transformations, storage, access patterns, and quality controls for data used by the product.
- **What lives here:** Source/ingress notes, entity schemas, lineage/transformations, retention/access rules, validation/SLOs, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (to validate data usage), data/analytics engineers, backend/frontend teams consuming data.
- **Source links:** Reference ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`, CMS schemas in `/specs/cms/`, and consuming specs in `/specs/routes-content/` or `/specs/components/`.
