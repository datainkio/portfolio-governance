# UX Specs

This folder captures user experience intent so AIX and teams align on flows, interaction patterns, and accessibility.

- **Role:** Define goals, flows, interaction patterns, content/voice, and accessibility expectations for key journeys.
- **What lives here:** Flow/area specs, personas/scenarios, user flows and states, interaction patterns (inputs, focus, motion), content/voice notes, accessibility requirements, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (to respect UX constraints), designers, frontend engineers, PMs.
- **Source links:** Tie to component specs in `/specs/components/`, routes in `/specs/routes-content/`, accessibility details in `/specs/ux/accessibility.md`, and ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`.
