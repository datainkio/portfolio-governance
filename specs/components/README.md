# Component Specs

This folder defines reusable UI components so AIX and engineers share the same APIs, states, and constraints.

- **Role:** Document component purpose, variants, APIs, styling tokens, accessibility requirements, and composition rules.
- **What lives here:** Component specs (inventory, props/slots/events, data shapes), styling/theming rules, a11y expectations, composition guidelines, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (to suggest correct props/usage), frontend engineers, designers.
- **Source links:** Tie to design artifacts in `/specs/ux/`, data contracts in `/specs/cms/`, and relevant ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`.
