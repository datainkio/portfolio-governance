# CMS Specs

This folder defines the CMS content contracts so AIX and clients agree on shapes, validation, and delivery behavior.

- **Role:** Specify content models, field rules, references, delivery/serialization, and governance for schema changes.
- **What lives here:** Content model specs, field definitions, linking rules, delivery/query expectations, migration/versioning notes, decisions, and open questions.
- **Consumers:** AIX (to enforce data shapes), frontend/backend engineers, content/platform teams.
- **Source links:** ADRs in `/docs/decisions/` for schema choices; related client specs in `/specs/routes-content/` and `/specs/components/`.
