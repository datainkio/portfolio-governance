# Documentation

This folder is the **human-facing docs hub** for the workspace.

## Audience convention

- `docs/` is written **for humans first** (onboarding, runbooks, navigation, and narrative documentation).
- AI should benefit from it, but canonical truth lives elsewhere.
- For source-of-truth constraints and durable contracts, prefer `context/` and `specs/`.

## Start here

- New to the repo: `docs/onboarding/README.md`

## Key areas

- Agents and roles: `docs/agents.md` (see also `.agent/` and `.copilot/`)
- Decisions (ADRs): `docs/decisions/`
- Runbooks (operational how-tos): `docs/runbooks/`
- Notes (exploration / not authoritative): `docs/notes/`
- Logs (historical records): `docs/logs/`

## Authority note

Some documents in `docs/` are narrative or historical.
For canonical constraints/goals and durable specs, prefer `context/` and `specs/`.
