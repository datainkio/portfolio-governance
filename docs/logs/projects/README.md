# Project Logs Index

This folder contains **project-specific operational artifacts** (audits, evaluations, maintenance notes) produced by Concierge and routed modules.

## Where to put things

- Scaffold-level hygiene and AIX maintenance logs: `docs/logs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- Project-level logs (for mounted repos): `docs/logs/projects/<project-slug>/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

> Use the **workspace folder name** as the default `<project-slug>` (e.g., `frontend`).
