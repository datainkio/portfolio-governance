# Hygiene & AIX Maintenance – 2026-01-16

## Summary
Small, non-invasive AIX maintenance pass focused on lowering human TTUO and reducing multi-root confusion. Added a concise Concierge prompt set + linked full catalog, removed legacy “Template Steward” agent references, and fixed VS Code tasks to work in paths containing spaces.

## Actions Taken
- Added concise “first sitting” + “regular lifecycle” Concierge prompt lists to the root README: [../../README.md](../../README.md)
- Created a full prompt catalog with guidance and examples: [../concierge-prompt-catalog.md](../concierge-prompt-catalog.md)
- Updated goals to reflect TTUO improvements via README prompt sets: [../../context/current-goals.md](../../context/current-goals.md)
- Fixed VS Code task commands to quote `${workspaceFolder}` (required when the workspace path contains spaces): [../../.vscode/tasks.json](../../.vscode/tasks.json)
- Replaced outdated “Template Steward” references with Concierge prompts:
  - [../getting-started.md](../getting-started.md)
  - [../../template_notes.md](../../template_notes.md)
  - [../audit_report_template.md](../audit_report_template.md)
- Updated “Migrator agent” wording to reflect Concierge as the only entrypoint (Migrator is a routed module):
  - [../../README.md](../../README.md)
  - [../getting-started.md](../getting-started.md)
  - [../migration.md](../migration.md)
- Added a VS Code task option to the current-goals runbook for lower TTUO: [../runbooks/current-goals.md](../runbooks/current-goals.md)
- Updated curated workspace map to remove a stale “missing” note for current goals: [../../.copilot/context/workspace-map.md](../../.copilot/context/workspace-map.md)
- Added `files.exclude` to match existing excludes (reduces Explorer noise in multi-root workspaces): [../../.vscode/settings.json](../../.vscode/settings.json)
- Reduced navigation ambiguity for logs by adding a project logs index and standardizing wording to `<project-slug>`:
  - [../logs/README.md](../logs/README.md)
  - [../logs/projects/README.md](../logs/projects/README.md)
  - [../../.copilot/context/workspace-map.md](../../.copilot/context/workspace-map.md)

## Findings
- VS Code tasks failed under a workspace path containing spaces due to unquoted `${workspaceFolder}`; quoting resolves it.
- Docs referenced a legacy agent name (“Template Steward”) even though Concierge is the only registered entrypoint; this increases CR/HF for new users.
- Some docs referred to “Migrator” as a separate agent; since Concierge is the entrypoint, this can increase wrong-agent selection.

## Recommendations / Follow-ups
- Consider adding one explicit “non-invasive by default” line to the prompt catalog template (to reinforce mounted-project safety).
- If you want scored metrics (FRA/CR/HF/TTUO/CUS), run a small probe set and record the results in a dedicated AIX snapshot entry.

## Metrics Snapshot
- FRA: not measured (no probe run)
- CR: 0 (no routing changes introduced)
- HF: 0 (no clarifications required)
- TTUO: improved (qualitative; prompt lists added to README)
- CUS: n/a (maintenance)
