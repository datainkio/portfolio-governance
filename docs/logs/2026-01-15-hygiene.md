# Hygiene Report – 2026-01-15

## Summary
Small scaffold hygiene refresh: added missing `.gitattributes`, created a canonical `context/current-goals.md` stub referenced by the workspace map, and corrected minor drift in curated docs. No generated artifacts or secrets detected.

## Actions Taken
- Added `.gitattributes` to normalize text EOLs and mark common binaries.
- Added `context/current-goals.md` stub (referenced as “Expected soon” in the workspace map).
- Updated `.copilot/context/workspace-map.md` to reflect that scripts exist and to clarify Obsidian config is optional/untracked.
- Fixed small typos in `context/README.md` (clarity for humans + agents).

## Findings
- `.vitaixmen.json` listed `.gitattributes` as a managed path, but the file was missing (now fixed).
- Curated docs drift: workspace map claimed “no scripts yet” while `scripts/README.md` documents `mounted-project-aix-audit.mjs`.
- `.env.example` is present but empty; consider adding commented placeholders if you want stronger first-run ergonomics.

## Recommendations / Follow-ups
- If this scaffold is used for repos that *do* commit media/assets, consider narrowing the broad media ignores in `.gitignore` at project creation time.
- Optionally add a tiny template to `.env.example` (comment-only) listing the common variables expected in downstream projects.

## Metrics Snapshot
- FRA: n/a (maintenance)
- CR: 0 (no routing changes)
- HF: 0 (no ambiguity requiring clarification)
- CUS: 0 (no external context needed)
