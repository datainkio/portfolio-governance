# Hygiene Report – 2026-01-13

## Summary
- Ran Quick Scan: required folders present; excludes mostly aligned; noted gaps in context stubs and a gitignore/VS Code exclude mismatch.

## Actions Taken
- Verified scaffold folders exist: /context, /specs, /docs/decisions, /docs/runbooks, /docs/notes, /docs/logs (root listing).
- Checked VS Code excludes for noise reduction: see [VS Code excludes](../../.vscode/settings.json#L1-L29).
- Reviewed gitignore patterns for alignment with excludes and ADR intent: see [.gitignore](../../.gitignore#L1-L120).
- Confirmed logging location exists for hygiene reports: [docs/logs/](README.md#L1-L21).

- .gitignore does not ignore the `.obsidian/` folder (only `.obsidian-workspace`), while VS Code excludes include it; ADR 0001 expects consistent excludes → potential drift. Reference [.gitignore](../../.gitignore#L20-L23) vs [VS Code excludes](../../.vscode/settings.json#L2-L27) and ADR in [docs/decisions/0001-vitaixmen-for-ai.md](../decisions/0001-vitaixmen-for-ai.md#L9-L21).
- Context stubs are empty and need population: [context/design-philosophy.md](../../context/design-philosophy.md), [context/constraints.md](../../context/constraints.md), [context/decisions.md](../../context/decisions.md).

## Recommendations / Follow-ups
- Add `.obsidian/` to .gitignore to align with VS Code excludes and ADR guidance.
- Populate context stubs (design philosophy, constraints, decisions) to reduce ambiguity and improve AIX.

## Metrics
- FRA: n/a (maintenance)
- CR: 0
- HF: 0
- CUS: 2 (used runbooks/ADR/context files)
- TTUO: 1 turn
