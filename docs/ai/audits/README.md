# AI Audits

This folder is reserved for **generated** audit outputs (often timestamped).

- Git ignores everything under `docs/ai/audits/` by default
- This `README.md` is intentionally tracked so the folder exists in fresh clones

If you need to keep a specific audit report long-term, move it to `docs/logs/` or a project-specific location and link it from the relevant runbook/ADR.
