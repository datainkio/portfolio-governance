# Copilot & AI Assistant Configuration

This folder defines how AI assistants should operate within this workspace.

It contains instructions, prompts, and curated context designed to help agents
understand the project structure, conventions, and expectations with minimal setup
and minimal noise.

Contents here are optimized for repeated ingestion by AI tools and may summarize or
link to canonical materials elsewhere in the workspace.

If conflicts arise, defer to the canonical context in `/context/`.
