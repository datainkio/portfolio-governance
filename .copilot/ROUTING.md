## Copilot Routing Canon

- There is exactly one user-facing agent: Concierge.
- All work is performed by applying ONE prompt module (max two if tightly coupled).
- Prefer domain-specific modules over generic ones.
- If unsure between two modules, choose the one with the clearer Primary Output.
- Do not invent new modules.
- Do not ask to switch agents.
