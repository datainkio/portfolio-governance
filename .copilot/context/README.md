# Agent Context (Curated)

This folder contains short, high-signal context files intended for AI agents.

These files prioritize clarity, brevity, and direct guidance over completeness.
They typically summarize or point to canonical context located in `/context/`.

Agents should read this folder first when starting work. Humans should treat it as
an orientation layer, not a source of truth.
